The purpose of this project is to implement test automation for an e-commerce website using Selenium, a widely used open-source tool for automating web browsers. The primary goals are to enhance the efficiency of testing processes, improve test coverage, and ensure the reliability of the e-commerce platform. Key components of the project scope include:

1. Test Environment Setup:

Establish a test environment with the necessary tools and dependencies, including Selenium WebDriver, testing frameworks (e.g., TestNG, JUnit), and build tools (e.g., Maven).
2. Test Case Identification and Prioritization:

Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and prioritize test cases based on critical functionalities, business logic, and user workflows.
Categorize tests into smoke tests, regression tests, and feature-specific tests.
3. Selenium WebDriver Scripting:

Develop Selenium WebDriver scripts to automate test cases identified in the previous step.
Utilize the appropriate programming language (e.g., Java, Python, C#) for Selenium script development.
4. Functional Testing:

Automate functional tests for core e-commerce features such as product browsing, search functionality, product details, shopping cart management, and checkout processes.
